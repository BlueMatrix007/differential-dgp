# Differentially deep Gaussian processes
Stochastic variational inference implementation for differentially deep Gaussian processes (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04066)

Most of the code is borrowed and modified from the following repositories:
 - gpflow https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow/ 
 - doubly-stochastic dgp https://github.com/ICL-SML/Doubly-Stochastic-DGP
